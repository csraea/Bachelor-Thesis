\chapter{ZÃ¡ver}
\label{summary}

During the work on this thesis I have dived into the field of bioinformatics, comprehensively analyzed the genome structure of different organisms, compared existing solutions and developed a new one.

The developed program operates upon the FASTA and GenBank files is capable of visualization SARS-CoV-2 genome and (partially) genomes of other organisms using different 2D visualization techniques.
Among them there is also an Improved 2D Matrix Method that was developed by me.

Future works and improvements can be mainly aimed at intoducing new visualization techniques, improving existing ones, adding a support for other genomes to make a tool universal and at providing a program with a graphical interface.
