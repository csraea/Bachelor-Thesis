abstract = {Abstract A genome browser is software that allows users to visualize DNA, protein, or other sequence features within the context of a reference sequence, such as a chromosome or contig. The Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) is an open-source browser developed as part of the Generic Model Organism Database project (Stein et al., 2002). GBrowse can be configured to display genomic sequence features for any organism and is the browser used for the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster (Grumbling and Strelets, 2006) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Schwarz et al., 2006), among others. The software package can be downloaded from the Web and run on a Windows, Mac OS X, or Unix-type system. Version 1.64, as described in the original protocol, was released in November 2005, but the software is under active development and new versions are released about every six months.

abstract = {ABSTRACT. In recent years, the amount of molecular sequencing data from Tetrahymena thermophila has dramatically increased. We analyzed G + C content, codon usage, initiator codon context and stop codon sites in the extremely A + T rich genome of this ciliate. Average G + C content was 38\% for protein coding regions. 21\% for 5′ non-coding sequences, 19\% for 3′ non-coding sequences, 15\% for introns, 19\% for micronuclear limited sequences and 17\% for macronuclear retained sequences flanking micronuclear specific regions. the 75 available T. thermophila protein coding sequences favored codons ending in T and, where possible, avoided those with G in the third position. Highly expressed genes were relatively G + C-rich and exhibited an extremely biased pattern of codon usage while developmentally regulated genes were more A + T-rich and showed less codon usage bias. Regions immediately preceding Tetrahymena translation initiator codons were generally A-rich. For the 60 stop codons examined, the frequency of G in the end + 1 site was much higher than expected whereas C never occupied this position.},

abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first major zoonotic infectious disease of the 21st Century. The disease, originally termed “atypical pneumonia,” was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections originated most likely from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to be effective in preventing further outbreaks in the region. Subsequent epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate host of SARS-CoV and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus–host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter focuses on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.}

Our objectives were to mutation analysis between recently reported genomes at various times and locations and to characterize the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics programs. Information on the variation of viruses is of considerable medical and biological impacts on the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of infectious diseases. To understand the genomic structure and variations of the SARS-CoV-2. The study analyzed 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences available in GenBank, National MicrobiologyData Center (NMDC) and NGDC Genome Warehouse from December-2019 until 05 of April-2020. The genomic signature analysis demonstrates that a strong association between the time of sample collection, location of sample and accumulation of genetic diversity. We found 116 mutations, the three most common mutations were 8782C>T in ORF1ab gene, 28144T>C in ORF8 gene and 29095C>T in the N gene. The mutations might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2. The finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt, inclusive investigations that combine genomic detail, epidemiological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.}

Frameshifts frequently confound computational activities involving homologous sequences, such as database searches and inferences on structure, function or phylogeny made from multiple alignments. A dynamic alignment algorithm is reported here which compares a protein profile (a residue scoring matrix for one or more aligned sequences) against the three translation frames of a DNA strand, allowing frameshifting. The algorithm has been incorporated into a new package, WiseTools, for comparison of biological sequences. A protein profile can be compared against either a DNA sequence or a protein sequence. The program PairWise may be used interactively for alignment of any two sequence inputs. SearchWise can perform combinations of searches through DNA or protein databases by a protein profile or DNA sequence. Routine application of the programs has revealed a set of database entries with frameshifts caused by errors in sequence determination.}",

ABSTRACT={Researchers seldom look at naked genome assemblies: instead the attributes of DNA sequences are mediated through statistics, annotations and high level summaries. Here we present software that visualizes the bare sequences of whole genome assemblies in a zoomable interface. This can assist in detection of chromosome architecture and contamination by the naked eye through changes in color patterns, in the absence of any other annotation. When available, annotations can be visualized alongside or on top of the naked sequence. Genome alignments can also be visualized, laying two genomes side by side in an alignment and highlighting their differences at nucleotide resolution. FluentDNA gives researchers direct visualization of whole genome assemblies, annotations and alignments, for quality control, hypothesis generation, and communicating results.}
